We already know which of the patients survived or not. From the machine learning perspective, that means we know the outcome labels.  Now, with the extracted features and the outcome labels, we can train a classifier to predict the survival status. For this task, we will use Support Vector Machine as a learning algorithm."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1133,"status":"ok","timestamp":1681891590561,"user":{"displayName":"Juran","userId":"08171557927159843276"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"Fh9mFSTKYhwL"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Importing the Feature set\n","\n","ct_features = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/My Drive/Data/ct_features.csv', header=None) \n","pet_features = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/My Drive/Data/pet_features.csv', header=None) \n","targets = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/My Drive/Data/labels.csv', header=None)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":331,"status":"ok","timestamp":1681891591923,"user":{"displayName":"Juran","userId":"08171557927159843276"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"GOln0e3WYhwN","outputId":"ed0cbcff-b368-4f5f-8e41-7a9d6c35ca8b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 1. 0.\n"," 0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 1. 1.]\n"]}],"source":["# Normalizing the feature set\n","\n","x_all_ct = ct_features.values[:, :]\n","x_all_ct = (x_all_ct-np.mean(x_all_ct))/np.std(x_all_ct)\n","\n","x_all_pet = pet_features.values[:,:]\n","x_all_pet = (x_all_pet-np.mean(x_all_pet))/np.std(x_all_pet)\n","\n","y_all = targets.values[:,0]  # Outcome Labels\n","print(y_all)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":457,"status":"ok","timestamp":1681891612520,"user":{"displayName":"Juran","userId":"08171557927159843276"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"K48Ovm-WYhwP"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Dividing the CT feature set into train and test sets\n","\n","X_train_CT, X_test_CT, y_train_CT, y_test_CT = train_test_split(x_all_ct, y_all, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":313,"status":"ok","timestamp":1681891614486,"user":{"displayName":"Juran","userId":"08171557927159843276"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"gtyAunIuYhwT","outputId":"7d61cfbd-b511-47b0-d7ef-dca686e3ccbe"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Accuracy Score: 0.7\n"]}],"source":["# Building a classifier model with CT features\n","\n","Model_CT = SVC(gamma='auto')\n","Model_CT.set_params(kernel='rbf').fit(X_train_CT,y_train_CT.ravel())  \n","\n","y_pred_CT = Model_CT.predict(X_test_CT) \n","FOS_CT_Acc = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test_CT,y_pred_CT)\n","print('Accuracy Score:',metrics.accuracy_score(y_test_CT,y_pred_CT))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":243,"status":"ok","timestamp":1681891628424,"user":{"displayName":"Juran","userId":"08171557927159843276"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"SSJ9zFXLYhwV"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Dividing the PET feature set into train and test sets\n","X_train_PET, X_test_PET, y_train_PET, y_test_PET = train_test_split(x_all_pet, y_all, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":447,"status":"ok","timestamp":1681891631495,"user":{"displayName":"Juran","userId":"08171557927159843276"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"bUCS4bW3YhwX","outputId":"a10e32b7-917d-4c4a-b3e1-6ab354cae0f8"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Accuracy Score: 0.9\n"]}],"source":["# Building a classifier model with PET features\n","\n","Model_PET = SVC(gamma='auto') \n","Model_PET.set_params(kernel='rbf').fit(X_train_PET,y_train_PET.ravel())  \n","\n","y_pred_PET = Model_PET.predict(X_test_PET) \n","FOS_PET_Acc = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test_PET, y_pred_PET)\n","print('Accuracy Score:',metrics.accuracy_score(y_test_PET,y_pred_PET))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"uKOwcPmtYhwY"},"outputs":[],"source":["# TODO\n","\n","# Which feature set have more prediction power?
